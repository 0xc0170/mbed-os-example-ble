GapButton
============
Broadcasting a count of number of button clicks over GAP. This is the simplest way to transmit information over ble. All listening devices in range will see the broadcast and be able to read the button clicks.

What Youâ€™ll Need
================
- You can use one of the generic apps to scan BLE peripherals.
  - For Android [nRF Master Control Panel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp&hl=en).
  - For iPhone [LightBlue](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lightblue-bluetooth-low-energy/id557428110?mt=8).
- One of the BLE platforms listed in the [README.md](https://github.com/ARMmbed/ble-examples/tree/oob-oct15) of this repository, for example a Nordic DK board.

Build Instructions
==================

After cloning the parent repository, switch to the subfolder BLE_HeartRate, and
execute the following:

```Shell
yotta target <an_appropriate_target_such_as_mkit-gcc>
yotta install
yotta build
```

Assuming that you're building for the nRF51 DK platform, available targets are
`nrf51dk-armcc` and `nrf51dk-gcc`. You can pick either.

The other targets you can use are described in the main README.md for this repository

The resulting binaries would be under `build/<yotta_target_name>/source/`.

Under that folder, the file called `ble-gapbutton<-combined>.hex` is the one which can be flashed to the target using mbed's DAP over USB; The parent README or the documentation for your yotta target will explain how to choose between the available binaries and hex files.

If you're building for the `nrf51dk-armcc` target, copy `build/nrf51dk-armcc/source/ble-gapbutton-combined.hex` to your target hardware, and reset the device.

Checking for Success
====================

By default the BLE device is called GapButton, but you can change this in `source\main.cpp`.

Open the BLE monitoring app on your phone, find the GapButton device, the button click count should show up in the "Manufacturer Data" field. Now click Button 1 on your board and the number should change on your phone.
