This example creates and updates a standard Battery Level service, and a single
GATT characteristic that contains the battery level.

Checking for Success
====================

Your BatteryLevel peripheral should be detectable by BLE scanners (e.g. a
smartphone). To use your phone as a BLE scanner simply install one of the
following apps:

- For Android, you can get [nRF Master Control Panel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp&hl=en).

- For iPhone, you can get [LightBlue](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lightblue-bluetooth-low-energy/id557428110?mt=8).

Using the phone app you can connect to the peripheral and observe how the
battery level characteristic changes.
