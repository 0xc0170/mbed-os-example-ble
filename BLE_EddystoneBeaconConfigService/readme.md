This is the EddystoneBeaconConfigService. This code starts up and for a user
configured time period (default 30 seconds) will advertise the configuration
service.

The configuration service allows for modifying various frames of the eddystone
specification. For more details on the Configuration Service please check
[here](https://github.com/google/eddystone/blob/master/eddystone-url/docs/config-service-spec.md).

Once the initial time period is up, the EddystoneBeaconConfigService will broadcast
advertisement packets with the configured eddystone frames.

What You’ll Need
================

To get this going, you’ll need:

- To see BLE devices and their advertisement or beacon information, get one of the following installed on your phone:

  - The `physical web` app. You can get that app for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/physical-web/id927653608?mt=8) and for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=physical_web.org.physicalweb).

  - For Android, you can get [nRF Master Control Panel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/detailsid=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp&hl=en).

  - For iPhone, you can get [LightBlue](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lightblue-bluetooth-low-energy/id557428110?mt=8).

- One of the BLE platforms listed in the README.md of this repository, for example a
  Nordic DK board.

Build Instructions
==================

After cloning the parent repository, switch to the subfolder BLE_EddystoneBeaconConfigService, and
execute the following:

```Shell
yotta target <an_appropriate_target_such_as_mkit-gcc>
yotta install
yotta build
```

Assuming that you're building for the nRF51 DK platform, available targets are
`nrf51dk-armcc` and `nrf51dk-gcc`. You can pick either.

The resulting binaries would be under `build/<yotta_target_name>/source/`.
Under that folder, the file called `ble-eddystonebeaconconfigservice-combined.hex` is the one which
can be flashed to the target using mbed's DAP over USB; the file called `ble-eddystonebeaconconfigservice`
is an ELF binary containing useful symbols; whereas `ble-eddystonebeaconconfigservice.hex`
can be used for Firmware-over-the-Air.

If you're building for the `nrf51dk-armcc` target, copy
`build/nrf51dk-armcc/source/ble-eddystonebeaconconfigservice-combined.hex` to your target hardware,
and reset the device.


Checking for Success
====================

Your EddystoneBeaconConfigService should be detectable by BLE scanners (e.g. a smartphone) and by the
Google Physical Web app.
